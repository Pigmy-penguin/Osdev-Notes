This repository is a collection of small documents, notes and articles about various osdev topics.

They are not meant to be exhaustive, just  personal notes. I will keep updating them while developing the OS.

They are divided by topic, and usually in addition to information widely available on internet. I also try to add information based on personal experience, advice received, or mistakes made. 

I hope that someone will find them useful.
